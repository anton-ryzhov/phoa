Notes on language files distribution
Applicable to PhoA version 1.1.6 beta and later
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This distribution includes the so-called language source file (phoa.dklang) for
PhoA program.

You make a so-called translation file (generally named Your_Language.lng) using
a special program called DKLang Translation Editor available for free download
at http://www.dk-soft.org/products/dklang/

Please send the translation you made to the address: phoa@narod.ru (specifying
[no-spam] in the subject line will give much more chances to bypass the spam
filter) so I can publish it for public access.

Please do not forget to:
  - Select an appropriate Target Language for the language you are translating
    to.
  - Correctly specify the program version the translation is for.
  - Specify your name in the 'Author' field, and, optionally, your email address
    which users can use to contact you.

Thanks and good luck,
