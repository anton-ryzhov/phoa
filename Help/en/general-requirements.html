<p>For the program to install you need an operating system, some disk space and a bit of RAM. To be more
  specific, <b>PhoA</b>  runs under <b>Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP</b>, takes approximately <b>2 MB of disk space</b>
  and requires at least <b>16 MB</b> of installed <b>RAM</b>. Because entire photo album file being opened is loaded
  into RAM, when opening file containing a lot of pictures (1000+) it is recommended to have adequate amount of RAM
  (32-64 MB on Windows 95/98/ME/NT, 128 MB on Windows 2000 &amp; XP).
