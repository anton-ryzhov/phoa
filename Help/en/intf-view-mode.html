<p align=justify>This mode allows you to view single pictures one by one - in the separate window or in fullscreen mode. And this is generally 
  what you create photo album for.
<p align=justify>In the view mode you can do the following:
<ul>
  <li>scale (zoom in and out) picture;</li>
  <li>scale picture to best fit the window;</li>
  <li>cancel scaling (view picture in its actual size);</li>
  <li>scroll picture with mouse or keyboard in case it doesn't fit the window;</li>
  <li>advance to next, previous, the first or the last picture in the current group;</li>
  <li>switch between window and fullscreen viewing mode;</li>
  <li>reload (re-read) picture file;</li>
  <li>edit current picture;</li>
  <li>turning on and off slideshow mode;</li>
  <li>open program preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p align=justify>These function are available through toolbar buttons, by context menu that appears when you right-click the window, or by
