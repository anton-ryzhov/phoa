<p align=center><img src="view-mode-chart.png">
<p>This mode allows you to view single pictures one by one - either in a separate window or in the
  full-screen mode. And this is probably what you create the photo album for.
<p>In the view mode you can do the following:
<ul>
  <li>scale (zoom in and out) the viewed picture;
  <li>scroll the picture with the mouse or keyboard in a case it isn't fully visible in the window;
  <li>advance to the next, the previous, the first or the last picture in the current view list;
  <li>switch between window and fullscreen viewing modes;
  <li>edit the current picture properties;
  <li>turning on and off the Slide Show mode;
  <li>open program preferences &amp; so on.
</ul>
<p>These functions are available through the <a href="intf-view-mode-menu.html"><b>Main Menu</b></a>,
  the <b>Toolbar</b> buttons, by using the <b>context menu</b> that appears when you right-click the window, or using
  the <a href="intf-ctl-viewer-key.html">keyboard</a> and <a href="intf-ctl-viewer-mouse.html">mouse</a> controls.
