<p align=justify>Operations dialog allows you to perform advanced processing on pictures and one of the photo album
  picture groups (except current). The operations are:
<ul>
  <li>Move selected pictures to highlighted group (the same as <a href="intf-browse-mode-tasks.html#dnd">dragging</a>
      pictures into this group);</li>
  <li>Add (copy) selected pictures to highlighted group (the same as
      <a href="intf-browse-mode-tasks.html#dnd">dragging</a> pictures into this group holding <b>Ctrl</b>
      depressed);</li>
  <li>Delete selected pictures from highlighted group (excluding; the group will contain all pictures but identical to
      selected ones);</li>
  <li>Intersect selected pictures with pictures in highlighted group (the group will contain only pictures identical to
      selected ones).</li>
</ul>
<p align=justify>The function allows to perform various tasks when arranging photo album contents (eg, you may wish to
  remove repeated pictures from other group or to copy some pictures from one group to another).
