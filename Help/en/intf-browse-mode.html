<p align=center><img src="browse-mode-chart.png">

<p>As it was mentioned above, the browse mode is intended for photo album creation. This mode is just one
  the program starts in.
<p>The main program window looks similar to standard Windows&reg; Explorer: the left pane displays
  folder-groups tree hierarchy while the right one gives us a list of thumbnails for the group selected in the left
  pane.
<p>Right to the left of the root tree node - the <i>photo album node</i> you can see a
  <a href="intf-browse-mode-menu.html#viewsmenu">drop-down menu button</a> allowing you to display menu with
  <a href="intf-browse-mode-views.html">photo album view</a> commands as well as for switching between views and photo
  album groups.
<p>It is also possible to use the <b>Space</b> key when the root node is highlighted to display that menu.
