{[%hh_hdr_en:Add pictures wizard :: Adding pictures]}

<p align=justify>This page is displayed while adding the selected picture files. The program shows picture addition progress and the number
  of errors occured. You can watch those errors (as well as pictures were added successfully) afterwards on the <a href="intf-pic-add-log.html">log
  page</a>.
<p align=justify>Moreover the <i>thumbnail</i> created for the picture last added is displayed.
<div class=nb><b>NB:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Picture additiong is performed by a parallel thread; you can interrupt the process only between two pictures being processing, and this
        slightly slows down the program's response on clicking <b>Interrupt</b> button.</li>
    <li>You <i>cannot</i> close the wizard window having active picture addition process. You will need to interrupt it using the <b>Interrupt</b>
        button before you can close the window.</li>
    <li>Picture addition process performs <a href="pic-prop-autofill.html">autofilling the picture data</a>. You can setup the autofill feature
        in the <a href="setup-dialogs.html">dialog settings</a>; autofill results can be watched at the <a href="intf-pic-add-log.html">log
        page</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>Interrupt</h3>
<p align=justify>By clicking this button you stop the addition process. The button becomes <b>Continue</b>, and by clicking it you resume the process.

<p align=justify>On process completion the program closes wizard window (only when no errors occured and <a href="setup-dialogs.html">settings</a> 
  specify not to show the log when no errors), or advances to the <a href="intf-pic-add-log.html">log page</a>.
