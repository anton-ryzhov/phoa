{[%hh_hdr_en:PhoA features and advantages]}

<p align=justify>It's definitely obvious that <b>PhoA</b> gives you many benefits when working with the photos, drawings and other highly creative
  artworks:
<ul>
  <li>The program does not require installation and (<i>presently</i>) consists of the only file <b>phoa.exe</b>. What does it mean? This means it
      can be copied along with created photo album file (<b>*.phoa</b>) everywhere you wish. When recording it on a CD-R having placed appropriate
      <b>autorun.inf</b> file to the root of the CD you can demostrate your pictures on any PC by simply inserting the CD in (on PCs keeping
      autorun feature turned on). The program won't blame you even if it couldn't find <b>phoa.chm</b> file beside, which represents <b>PhoA</b>
      Help System.</li>
  <li>The program allows you to build up catalogues (called <i>photo albums</i>) on completely different pictures. Pictures are arranged into groups
      similar to folders in Windows Explorer. Source images can be almost of any raster format, and also a number of vector formats are supported.
      Details on supported file formats are <a href="general-file-formats.html">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Each picture may be described by date, place, film and frame number, keywords, description, author and so on. A <i>thumbnail</i> - shrinked view of
      a picture - is generated automatically (a number of <a href="info-resampling.html">resampling</a> algorithms implemented). Thumbnail dimensions
      can be specified in <a href="intf-album-props.html">photo album properties</a>, thumbnails themselves are stored in the photo album file;
      this allows nearly instant photo album opening and viewing. Thumbnails are being compressed with JPEG algorithm and may be cached while
      viewing.</li>
  <li><b>PhoA</b> allows momentary photo album <a href="intf-search.html">searches</a> by picture file name, by date range, place, keywords,
      description text etc.; search results are displayed as a group-tree node and can be merged with pictures from any group.</li>
  <li>Photo album file holds relative paths to pictures thus allowing to move it anywhere just keeping the photo album file's original relation 
      to pictures. But when photo album file is placed on a different disk or on a network server (and vice versa: picture files are on a network disk
      while the photo album file resides on the local one), then the album file holds absolute paths and its placement relative to <i>these</i>
      pictures doesn't matter.</li>
  <li>There's an option for displaying thumbnails' tooltips in the browse mode. Tooltips' content is also
      <a href="setup-browse-mode.html">adjustable</a>.</li>
  <li><b>PhoA</b> implements a picture <a href="intf-sort-pics.html">sorting</a> feature for selected group or the whole photo album. Sorting
      criteria include almost all available data, sorting set may contain arbitrary number of criteria; the last used set is remembered.</li>
  <li>There are <a href="intf-browse-mode-views.html"><i>views</i></a> implemented: a brand-new technology for the browse mode. You can classify
      a heap of pictures into folders with minimum efforts. The only requirement is that pictures' properties are properly filled. These properties
      are used for grouping pictures in tree folders. Possible grouping conditions are: by picture file path, by date and time (in various ways), by
      place, by keywords etc. Groupings may be cascaded, ie may be applied one by one, number of groupings is a matter of sanity. The result of the
      grouping (folder tree along with their pictures) may be easily <a href="intf-sel-phoa-group.html">put into any photo album group</a>, and after
      that you can tweak them in usual way.</li>
  <li><b>PhoA</b> is capable for <a href="intf-view-mode.html">viewing pictures</a> (in window or full-screen mode) as well as their descriptions.
      Viewing parameters are <a href="setup-view-mode.html">adjusted in program settings</a>; there are slideshow mode, picture scaling (zoom in
      and out with a number of resampling algorithms) and panning with <a href="intf-controls.html">mouse or keyboard</a>. Pictures are
      being decoded by a parallel thread thus allowing background loading while viewing another picture. Also there's an option for caching the
      last viewed picture.</li>
  <li>The program supports <a href="intf-browse-mode-tasks.html#clipboard">clipboard operations</a>: you can copy or cut selected pictures into
      the clipboard and paste them into another group or even another photo album; there's also a possibility to paste files in Explorer or
      file list in a text editor.</li>
  <li>There is fully operational <a href="intf-browse-mode-tasks.html#undo"><i>undo system</i></a>: any wrong operation may be rolled back (the
      same for group of operations). The undo buffer capacity is specified through <b>PhoA</b> <a href="setup-browse-mode.html">settings</a>.</li>      
  <li>The program allows performing of some kinds of <a href="intf-file-ops.html">file operations</a>:
      <a href="intf-file-ops-task-copy.html">copying</a>, <a href="intf-file-ops-task-move.html">moving</a>,
      <a href="intf-file-ops-task-del.html">deletion</a> etc. In particular there's a built-in mechanism for preparing the photo album (or view,
      or any part of them) for writing onto a <b>CD</b>, <b>DVD</b> or another removable medium.</li>
  <li>There are also a number of tool features (<a href="intf-stats.html">statistics</a>, <a href="intf-pic-operations.html">inter-group
      operations</a> etc.)</li>
  <li><b>PhoA</b> looks good, has pretty suave manner and a handly interface. What else you may need?</li>
</ul>  

<p class=lsmall><u>Note</u>. Photo album file (<b>.phoa</b>) format is subject to change along with program is being developed. I will make maximum
  efforts to keep the downward compatibility, ie newer program versions should open (and even save) files of older versions.
