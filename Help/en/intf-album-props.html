{[%hh_hdr_en:Photo Album properties dialog]}

<p align=justify>This dialog allows you to define photo album thumbnail parameters - the dimensions (width and height in pixels) and compression, or
  quality. Default thumbnail dimensions are 150x150 pixels, quality is 40% max. The greater thumbnail dimensions and the higher quality mean the greater
  photo album file (<b>*.phoa</b>) size, and vice versa. Too low thumnail quality may make it difficult to recognize picture it represents
  (colors appear distorted).
<p align=justify>You can also enter photo album text description here; the description is stored along with the photo album.
<div class=nb><b>NB:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>After you have changed thumbnail parameters <b>the thumbnails are to be rebuilt</b> as those parameters will only affect the newly added pictures.
        You <a href="intf-file-ops-task-rthumb.html">rebuild the thumbnails</a> using the <a href="intf-file-ops.html">File operations wizard</a>.</li>
    <li>Besides the dimensions and compression the thumbnail quality is affected by <a href="theory-resampling.html">resampling method</a> being used.
        To configure resampling use the <a href="setup-browse-mode.html">Browse mode settings</a> (this setting is global for all the photo albums, and
        changing it also requires rebuilding all the thumbnails).</li>
    <li>Description length is not limited but it's not recommended to make descriptions over 80 printed pages in length because they are difficult to read.</li>
  </ul>
