{[%hh_hdr_en:Photo Album properties dialog]}

<p align=justify>This dialog allows you to define photo album thumbnail parameters - the dimensions (width and height in
  pixels) and compression, or quality. Default thumbnail dimensions are 150x150 pixels, quality is 40% max. The greater
  thumbnail dimensions and the higher quality, the greater photo album file (<b>*.phoa</b>) size is, and vice versa. Too
  low thumnail quality may make it difficult to recognize picture it represents (colors appear distorted).
<p align=justify>You can also enter photo album text description here; the description is stored within the photo album.

<div class=nb><b>NB:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>After you have changed thumbnail parameters <b>the thumbnails should be rebuilt</b> as those parameters will
        only affect the newly added pictures. You <a href="intf-file-ops-task-rthumb.html">rebuild the thumbnails</a>
        using the <a href="intf-file-ops.html">File operations wizard</a>.
    <li>Besides the dimensions and compression the thumbnail quality is affected by
        <a href="info-resampling.html">resampling method</a> being used. To configure resampling use the
        <a href="setup-browse-mode.html">Browse mode settings</a> (this setting is global for all the photo albums, and
        changing it also requires rebuilding all the thumbnails).
    <li>Description length is not limited but it's not recommended to make descriptions over 80 printed pages in length
        because they are difficult to read.
  </ul>
