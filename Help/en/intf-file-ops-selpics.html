<table class=plain border=0>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>Selected pictures</td>
    <td>The operation you have selected will process the pictures selected in the thumbnail window. For cases when a
        group is required for the operation the photo album or view group currently selected is used.<br>
        This mode is the default when you start the wizard, and thumbnail window has focus and selected pictures as
        well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>All pictures in the photo album/view</td>
    <td>The operation will use all the pictures and all photo album groups (in the case picture groups are displayed) or
        all <a href="intf-browse-mode-views.html">view</a> groups (when a view is active).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>Pictures in selected groups</td>
    <td>You decide which groups and pictures will participate in the operation by checking them in the tree. You can
        only check the groups which actually contain pictures.<br>
        This mode is the default when wizard starts and group tree has focus; the group currently selected gets checked
        immediately (unless it doesn't contain pictures).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class=tblhdr>
    <td colspan=2>Additional options are available in the popup menu accessible with right mouse click or with
        <b>Shift+F10</b> shortcut keys:</td>

    <td class=command>Check all groups</td>
    <td>(or <b>Ctrl+A</b>) Sets check to all the groups having pictures.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>Uncheck all groups</td>
    <td>(or <b>Ctrl+D</b>) Removes check from all the checked groups.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>Invert group checks</td>
    <td>(or <b>Ctrl+I</b>) Toggles all groups' check state.</td>
  </tr>

<p align=justify><b>Info line</b> at the bottom of the page displays how many groups and pictures the selection actually
  contains; also the total size for picture files is displayed.

  <ul>
    <li>In the case <a href="intf-file-ops-moveopts.html">copy/move options</a> allow file duplication the total size
        may prove greater than indicated one.</li>
    <li>The space occupied by a file on the disk is usually greater than its size. You should have this in mind when
        preparing the files to write onto a removable medium.</li>
