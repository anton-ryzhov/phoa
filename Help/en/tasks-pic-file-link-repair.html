{[%hh_hdr_en:Common tasks :: Picture file link repairing]}

<p>As is well known, <b>PhoA</b> photo album groups contain links to pictures, while each picture refers a
  corresponding image file.

<p>A saved photo album file holds <i>relative</i> links to picture files whenever possible. This means, if
  you move a photo album file <i>together</i> with image files (keeping their relative placement unchanged), all picture
  file links will remain valid.

<p>To move image files independently from photo album file the program provides the special
  <a href="intf-file-ops-task-move.html">move picture files operation</a>.

<p>But when you move an image file <i>outside</i> the program, the corresponding link gets broken, or
  lost, i.&nbsp;e. points to nowhere.

<p>You can fix this in the two ways:

<ul>
  <li>A &quot;soft&quot; method: you indicate a new placement of the file.
  <li>A &quot;hard&quot; method: you delete all the images linked to non-existent files. In that case you lose all the
      information entered for those pictures.
</ul>

{[%hh_h2:Changing picture file link]}

<ol>
  <li>Select thumbnails of the images you would like to relink.
  <li>Select the <b>{[%hh_ii:Edit]} Edit | Edit...</b> menu item: this will show the Picture properties dialog.
  <li>Open the <b>File properties</b> page of the dialog.
  <li>Select a file in the list and click the <b>{[%hh_ii:Edit]} Change file...</b> toolbar button.
  <li>In the appeared dialog select a new location of the picture file and click <b>Open</b>.
  <li>Repeat items <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> for each of the broken links.
  <li>Save changes to file links by clicking <b>OK</b> in the Picture properties dialog.
</ol>

{[%hh_h2:Delete picture files operation]}

<p>To remove all images having no valid file linked perform the following steps.

<ol>
  <li>Launch the <b>File operations wizard</b>. You do it by selecting the <b>{[%hh_ii:FileOps]} Tools | File
      operations...</b> menu item.

  <li>On the first page of the wizard select <b>Delete pictures and files</b> and click <b>Next</b>.

  <li>Select <b>All pictures in the photo album</b>, and in the <b>File link validity filter</b> select <b>Only pictures
      having NO valid (existent) file linked</b>.
      <p><b>WARNING!</b> A little mistake here can cause that all of your files will be deleted so be
      careful!

  <li>As long as we are deleting only pictures with no existent file linked, option for removing to the Recycle Bin
      makes no sense. After clicking <b>Next</b> the program will start removing pictures.
</ol>
