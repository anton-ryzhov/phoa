<h3>Files/folders list</h3>

<h3>Recurse subfolders</h3>
<p align=justify>If there are folders selected in the tree, then having this checkbox turned on you add files not only from that folders, but also
  from all the nested folders.

<h3>Advanced</h3>

<h3>Photo album presence</h3>
<p align=justify>Allows you to filter picture files on their presence in the photo album:
<ul>
  <li><b>Disregard</b> - the filter is ignored.</li>
  <li><b>Only files which are absent at the photo album</b> - only files will be added which are not yet in the common photo album picture list.</li>
  <li><b>Only files which are present at the photo album</b> - only files will be added which are already contained in the photo album.</li>
</ul>

<h3>File masks</h3>
