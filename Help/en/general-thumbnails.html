<p>Maximum dimensions of thumbnails being created for added pictures depend on
  <a href="intf-album-props.html">album properties</a> (ie. every photo album can hold its own thumbnail
  specifications), the default values is 150 by 150 pixels. If a picture does not fit these dimensions, thumbanail is
  created by scaling the picture appropriately.
<p><b>PhoA</b> thumbnails are always stored in <a href="general-file-formats.html">JPEG format</a>, which
  causes from the most effective compression of this format. You can control the quality of thumbnails being created
  with program settings: higher thumbnail quality simplifies picture identification but causes more space usage. Because
  thumbnails are contained within photo album files (<b>*.phoa</b>), their dimensions and quality directly affect
  resulting album file size as well as space allocated for album in memory when opening it.
