{[%hh_hdr_en:Working in the view mode]}

<p align=justify>The behaviour of the program is completely determined by <a href="setup-view-mode.html">view mode settings</a>. Some parameters
  you can also override in the current viewing session. Eg, you can switch between window and fullscreen mode by pressing the <b>F</b> key or
  with clicking by middle mouse button. In window mode settings specify whether picture is scaled (zoomed in) in case it is smaller than the window,
  or is it shrinked when it is larger than the window; whether viewing windows is alaways on top of other windows; for both modes you can specify
  window background color.
<p align=justify>Moreover, <b>PhoA</b> is able to display picture information when viewing it (else what is it for?).
<p align=justify>You can zoom the picture being viewed in and out with mouse wheel (keeping <b>Ctrl</b> depressed) or with <b>+</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>*</b>,
  <b>/</b> keys on the numeric keypad. If picture is larger than the viewing window it can be scrolled by dragging it with mouse or with arrow keys
  (also in conjunction with <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>Shift</b> keys). To learn more on using keyboard and mouse in the view mode refer to 
  <a href="intf-key-mouse-controls.html">this chapter</a>.

<div class=nb><b>NB:</b> Maximum scaling factor for this version of <b>PhoA</b> is <b>8</b>.</div>
