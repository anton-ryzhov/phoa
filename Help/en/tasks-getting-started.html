{[%hh_h2:<a name=arranging_files></a>File arranging]}

<p align=justify>As a matter of fact, creating a photo album starts some time before launching the program. As long as
  <b>PhoA</b> is an image catalogue program, you will have to decide in which way you will store your image files on a
  drive.

<p align=justify>Although physical file layout does not mean much to the program, you as an end user will probably
  prefer a single root folder for folders with image files. That folders in turn will probably be arranged on a some
  temporal basis: by date and/or event. This way files will be divided to some more or less manageable portions.
  Besides, this will reduce a risk of file name conflict.

<p align=justify>Therefore try to tidy up your image file archive a bit for a start. You will be able to remove all
  unneeded pictures later, after they are added to the photo album.

{[%hh_h2:<a name=pic_adding></a>Adding pictures to the photo album]}

<p align=justify>Once you are finished with tiding up your image files you can start creating a photo album. And you do
  it by launching the program.

<p align=justify>Upon start the program will create a new blank album and highlight its root item: the <b>Photo
  Album</b>. We will add the pictures just there.

<p align=justify>Select the <b>{[%hh_ii:NewPic]} Edit | Add pictures...</b> menu item. This will open the Add pictures
  wizard.
  There you select just that root folder described in the previous chapter; also make sure <b>Recurse subfolders</b>
  check box is on. Then click <b>Next</b> twice and wait until picture files are added.

{[%hh_h2:<a name=group_creation></a>Creating picture group layout]}

<p align=justify>To simplify picture search it is necessary to arrange pictures by some criteria. Usually it is easy to
  determine a place or an event related to a number of pictures, create a group for it and place those pictures there.

<p align=justify>To create a group select the <b>{[%hh_ii:NewGroup]} Edit | Add group</b> menu item, type in a new group
  name (for example, &quot;Our vacation 2005&quot;) and press <b>Enter</b>. This will create a new group within the root
  <b>{[%hh_ii:PhoA]} Photo Album</b> folder. Subsequently select <b>{[%hh_ii:PhoA]} Photo Album</b> tree node, and in
  the thumbnail window select those pictures about that vacation, and then drag them with left mouse button to the
  &quot;Our vacation 2005&quot; group.

<p align=justify>Repeat the actions for each other event.

{[%hh_h2:<a name=filling_pic_props></a>Filling picture data]}

<p align=justify>Pictures added to the photo album will have filled only date and time, and even those will be correct
  only if pictures had appropriate <a href="info-metadata.html">metadata</a>.

<p align=justify>A good photo album should provide you with maximum available information about a picture, and the
  program will help you to achieve this.

<p align=justify>Select one or more pictures (thumbnails) and select the <b>{[%hh_ii:Edit]} Edit | Edit...</b> menu
  item. This will open the Picture properties dialog. Select the <b>Data</b> page and fill in all the available data for
  the pictures. If you have selected more than one picture, the entered values will be applied to them all.

<p align=justify>Using <i>keywords</i> (displayed on the corresponding page of the same dialog) should be a separate
  subject. Most often keywords (or <i>key phrases</i>) are people or subjects photographed. But you are welcome to
  invent a new purpose for them.

<p align=justify>By the way, <b>Groups</b> page of the dialog is an alternate way to arranging pictures to groups
  (besides the one described above).

{[%hh_h2:<a name=photo_album_saving></a>Photo album saving]}

<p align=justify>You probably don't wish to lose all you have done, do you? So let's save your brand new photo album to
  a disk file (use the <b>{[%hh_ii:SaveAs]} File | Save as...</b> menu item for that). The program will store all
  thumbnails, the associated data and groups to a file having <b>.phoa</b> extension, so you can open it later.
