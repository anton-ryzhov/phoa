{[%hh_h2:Q&A]}

<p class=faqq><a name=getting-started></a>I have read and understood all the program documentation. But how in a hell do
  I create a photo album?
<p class=faqa>Take it easy, all you have to do:
  <ul>
    <li>You can create some folders (groups) for pictures. You do it by selecting <b>{[%hh_ii:NewGroup]} Edit | Add
        group</b> menu item or by pressing <b>Alt+Ins</b> shortcut keys - then the group is created &quot;inside&quot;
        the group currently selected. You may skip this step and add pictures directly to the photo album.
    <li>Highlight a folder to add pictures to (group or the photo album node).
    <li>Select <b>{[%hh_ii:NewPic]} Edit | Add pictures...</b> menu item, Add pictures Wizard opens.
    <li>At the first page you select a folder with pictures. Check the checkbox <b>Recurse subfolders</b> if it contains
        nested folders with pictures. Click <b>Next &gt;</b>.
    <li>At the <b>Check files</b> page you can choose exactly which files are to be added to the photo album. All the
        files are checked by default. Click <b>Next &gt;</b>, and the adding process will start.
    <li>After adding has finished the program closes Wizard window and you see your pictures, or advances to the
        <b>Log</b> page (click <b>Close</b> if this is the case) - according to the program settings.
    <li>Save photo album to a file. That's all!
  </ul>

<p class=faqq><a name=choose-language></a>How to switch to another interface language?
<p class=faqa>The default interface language is determined by the language used during program installation. You can
  change it by selecting <b>{[%hh_ii:Props]} Tools | Program settings...</b> menu item -&gt; <b>{[%hh_ii:Props]}
  General</b> page -&gt; <b>Interface language</b>.
<p align=right><a href=#top>Top</a>
<hr>

<p class=faqq><a name=thumb-dimensions></a>How do I change default thumbnail dimensions?
<p class=faqa>Each photo album can have its own thumbnail dimensions. These data are stored along with the photo album;
  you can alter it by selecting the photo album node in the group tree, and then selecting <b>{[%hh_ii:Edit]} Edit |
  Edit...</b> menu item.
<p align=right><a href=#top>Top</a>
<hr>

<p class=faqq><a name=thumb-quality></a>How can I enhance thumbnail quality?
<p class=faqa>Thumbnail quality is affected by the two factors:
  <ul>
    <li><b><a href="info-resampling.html">Resampling filter</a> used</b>. Nearest Neighbor is the most quick one but
        images downsampled with it appear &quot;fuzzy&quot;. The most soft contours are achieved by using B-spline, then
        Linear filters. You get more plain lines with Lanczos filter. To change resampling filter, select
        <b>{[%hh_ii:Props]} Tools | Program settings...</b> -&gt; <b>{[%hh_ii:Folder]} Browse mode</b> -&gt;
        <b>Resampling filter</b>.
    <li><b>Compression level</b>. Thumbnails are stored in JPEG format; this format compresses images with the price of
        some quality loss. You can change &quot;size/quality&quot; ratio for each photo album individually, by selecting
        photo album node in the group tree, and then <b>{[%hh_ii:Edit]} Edit | Edit...</b> menu item.
  </ul>

<p class=faqq><a name=writing-to-cd></a>Is it possible to write my photo album to a CD-ROM along with the program so I
  can view it on any computer?
<p class=faqa>Yes, it is. PhoA has been designed specially so as photo albums can be written onto a removable
  media together with the viewing tool itself:
  <ul>
    <li>Photo album files store <b>relative</b> links to picture files, whenever possible (relative to photo album
        file). Absolute linkage is used for pictures residing on a drive other than photo album's one, or on network
        drives. This allows writing photo album and pictures on a removable disk provided their relative position is
        <b>unchanged</b>. E.g.:
        <ul>
          <li>Before writing: photo album file: <b>C:\My documents\Photos.phoa</b>; base picture files folder:
              <b>C:\My documents\Pics</b>
          <li>After writing (onto a CD-ROM): photo album file: <b>D:\Photos.phoa</b>; base picture files folder:
              <b>D:\Pics</b>
        </ul>

    <li>PhoA doesn't require any additional files to run besides the main executable <b>phoa.exe</b>. You can
        place it in any folder on the CD.
    <li>For the program to load a given photo album, specify its path in the command line, eg: <b>phoa.exe
        Photos.phoa</b>
    <li>The most simple and efficient way to prepare the files and the photo album for writing onto a removable medium
        is using the <a href="intf-file-ops-task-copy.html">Copy files operation</a>.
  </ul>

<p class=faqq><a name=autorun></a>How do I write <b>autorun.inf</b> file for the photo album on a CD-ROM starts
  automatically?
<p class=faqa>The basic <b>autorun.inf</b> usage is like the following (you create it using any text editor, then place
  it into the root CD-ROM directory):
<pre>[autorun]
open=phoa.exe Photos.phoa
icon=phoa.exe,1
label=My photo album</pre>
  This example assumes both program executable (<b>phoa.exe</b>) and photo album file (<b>Photos.phoa</b>) reside in
  root directory of the CD (so the <b>autorun.inf</b> does).<br>
  <span class=fp>icon=</span> line specifies a file containing icon to display in &quot;My computer&quot;, and icon
  index (zero-based) in that file. For <b>phoa.exe</b>:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>0</b> - the program's icon;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1</b> - photo album file's icon.<br>
  <span class=fp>label=</span> line specifies a drive label to display in &quot;My computer&quot;.
  Refer to
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_basics/shell_basics_extending/autorun/autoplay_cmds.asp">MSDN
  documentation</a> for details.
  <div class=nb><b>NB:</b> It is possible to use the autorun.inf creation feature of the
    <a href="intf-file-ops-task-copy.html">Copy files operation</a>.</div>

<p class=faqq><a name=open-album-on-startup></a>I want the program to open my photo album automatically when I start it.
  How?
<p class=faqa>You should start the photo album file itself, not the program. Eg. put a shortcut to your photo album
  <b>C:\My documents\Photos.phoa</b>, onto the Desktop, so when you execute it PhoA will start first, then the
  program will load this photo album.

<p class=faqq><a name=relocating-pics></a>Is it possible to alter picture file paths?
<p class=faqa>Firstly, you are able to move picture files together with the photo album file provided their relative
  placement is unchanged (see <a href=#writing-to-cd>writing to a CD</a>).<br>
  Secondly, you can move picture files by using the <a href="intf-file-ops-task-move.html">Move files operation</a>.<br>
  And thirdly, you may change picture file immediately using <b>Change file...</b> button on
  <a href="intf-pic-props-fprops.html">File properties</a> page of the <a href="intf-pic-props.html">Picture properties
  dialog</a>.
