{[%hh_hdr_en:Common tasks :: Picture deletion]}

<p>It would be better to clarify some things about deleting pictures in <b>PhoA</b>.

<p>As a matter of fact, photo album groups contain links to the pictures, while a picture links a
  corresponding disk file.

<p>Hence when you delete a picture from a group, this does not mean the picture is removed from the album.
  The picture is actually removed from the photo album only when it is completely removed from all its groups.

<p>Moreover, when you completely remove a picture from the album, this does not delete the corresponding
  file so it remains on the disk.

<p>In order to find out which groups a picture is belonging to you can use the
  <a href="intf-pic-props-groups.html"><b>Groups</b></a> page of the Picture properties dialog. And how do you remove
  unneeded pictures (for example, bad photos) with corresponding files is described below.

{[%hh_h2:Delete picture files operation]}

<p>To delete pictures with corresponding files <b>PhoA</b> provides the File operations wizard.

<ol>
  <li>Select thumbnails you would like to delete.

  <li>Launch the <b>File operations wizard</b>. You do it by selecting the <b>{[%hh_ii:FileOps]} Tools | File
      operations...</b> menu item.

  <li>On the first page of the wizard select <b>Delete pictures and files</b> and click <b>Next</b>.

  <li>If at the moment you started the wizard the thumbnail window was active, the <b>Selected pictures</b> radio button
      will be checked by default. That is just the same you need.

  <li>On the next page you can select whether files are wiped completely or just moved to the Recycle Bin (in the latter
      case you can undo the deletion later; but you would be able to recover deleted files, not the pictures deleted
      from the album). After clicking <b>Next</b> the program will start picture and file deletion.
</ol>
