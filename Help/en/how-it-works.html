{[%hh_hdr_en:How it works]}

<p align=justify>The main program principle is storing <b>the links to the pictures</b> or, to be more specific, to picture files. As long as pictures
  are stored separately, it is possible to copy them independently from program, to view them with third-party tools as well as to
  reduce the space needed to copy a link.
<p align=justify>Pictures are arranged (gathered) into <b>groups</b>, and the group are arranged hierarchically as a tree, similar to
  folder tree in the Windows Explorer. Groups are displayed as folders in the left program window pane while the pictures contained in
  the group do so in the right pane.
<p align=justify>Note that groups do not directly link the pictures. These links are stored in a common list (containing
  links to all photo album pictures), items of which containt <a href="pic-data.html">description data</a>.
<p align=justify>Groups are filled from this common link list so groups contain &quot;links to links to pictures&quot;. If that's still not clear
  then look to the picture:
<p align=center><img src="pic-oranization.png" width=454 height=323>
<p align=justify>What does it tell us about? It does tell us that picture once described in <b>PhoA</b> can be added to any (or even all) of the
  groups thus copying only link to it and keeping the actual link to the file (with appropriate description, date, place etc) only once.
