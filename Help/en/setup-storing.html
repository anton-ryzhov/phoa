  <h1><img src="../h1-bullet.gif" align=absmiddle width=22 height=22> Storing the program settings in a file</h1>

  <p align=justify><b>PhoA</b> program like most Windows applications automatically stores customized settings in the System Registry. These settings
    cover not only specified in <a href="setup-general.html">Program settings dialog</a> ones, but also some other interface options such as window
    sizes, toolbar positions and history lists.

  <p align=justify>As a bonus you can store settings in a file - it is useful eg when you run the program on another computer and don't want to
    set up all the parameters again.

  <p align=justify><b>PhoA</b> allows storing current program settings as a regular Windows ini file. You perform this by selecting <b>File |
    Save current settings to file...</b> menu item, or by pressing <b>Shift+Ctrl+S</b> shortcut keys. This invokes standard File Save dialog to
    enter the name of a file to save settings to. By default the program uses <b>phoa.ini</b> file.

  <p align=justify>If it is possible to save settings to a file, it is indeed to load them from a file too. You load settings by selecting 
    <b>File | Load settings from file...</b> menu item, or using <b>Shift+Ctrl+O</b> shortcut keys. The dialog that appears you fill the file you
    have previously saved settings to. By default the <b>phoa.ini</b> file is suggested.

  <p align=justify>The <b>phoa.ini</b> file have a special meaning: if it is present in the same folder as the program (<b>phoa.exe</b>) itself, 
    it gets loaded when <b>PhoA</b> starts. This default behaviour can be changed in <a href="setup-general.html">General program settings</a> -
    the <b>Load settings from phoa.ini if it is present in the program folder, on startup</b> can be turned off which means no <b>phoa.ini</b>
    autoloading occurs.

  <div class=nb><b>NB:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>It might be already obvious that settings are being loaded in the following order: at first data are loaded from the Registry,
          and then (if this is enabled) - from <b>phoa.ini</b>. Thus all settings not covered by the file are taken from the Registry.</li>
      <li>ini file stores settings not related to window dimensions only. Window sizes, positions, states, toolbar positions and visibility are always
          stored locally, in the Registry.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
