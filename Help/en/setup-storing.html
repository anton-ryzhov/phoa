{[%hh_hdr_en:Storing the program settings in a file]}

<p align=justify><b>PhoA</b> program like most Windows applications automatically stores customized settings in the
  System Registry. These settings cover not only specified in <a href="setup-general.html">Program settings dialog</a>
  ones, but also some other interface options such as window sizes, toolbar positions and history lists.

<p align=justify>As a bonus you can store settings in a file - it is useful eg when you run the program on another
  computer and don't want to set up all the parameters again.

<p align=justify><b>PhoA</b> allows storing current program settings as a regular Windows ini file. You perform this by
  selecting <b>{[%hh_ii:SaveSettings]} File | Save current settings to file...</b> menu item, or by pressing
  <b>Shift+Ctrl+S</b> shortcut keys. This invokes standard File Save dialog to enter the name of a file to save settings
  to. By default the program uses <b>phoa.ini</b> file.

<p align=justify>If it is possible to save settings to a file, it is indeed to load them from a file too. You load
  settings by selecting <b>{[%hh_ii:LoadSettings]} File | Load settings from file...</b> menu item, or using
  <b>Shift+Ctrl+O</b> shortcut keys. The dialog that appears you fill the file you have previously saved settings to. By
  default the <b>phoa.ini</b> file is suggested.

<p align=justify>The <b>phoa.ini</b> file have a special meaning: if it is present in the same folder as the program
  (<b>phoa.exe</b>) itself, it gets loaded when <b>PhoA</b> starts. This default behaviour can be changed in
  <a href="setup-general.html">General program settings</a> - the <b>Load settings from phoa.ini if it is present in the
  program folder, on startup</b> can be turned off which means no <b>phoa.ini</b> autoloading occurs.

<div class=nb><b>NB:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>It might be already obvious that settings are being loaded in the following order: at first data are loaded from
        the Registry, and then (if this is enabled) - from <b>phoa.ini</b>. Thus all settings not covered by the file
        are taken from the Registry.
    <li>An ini-file stores settings not related to the local machine only. Window sizes, positions, states, toolbar
        positions and visibility, and also the <a href="setup-tools.html">Tools settings</a> are always being stored
        locally in the Registry.
  </ul>
</div>
