{[%hh_hdr_en:Major modes]}

<p>PhoA program can work in two major modes:
<ul>
  <li>browsing and arranging pictures;
  <li>viewing pictures.
</ul>
<p>These modes are functionally the same as in some well-known program (needn't to pronounce names).
  Things do not like making them twice...

{[%hh_h2:Browse mode]}
<p>In this mode the main application window is very similar to standard Windows Explorer: there's a group
  (folder) tree in the left pane, and thumbnail and their descriptions are being displayed in the right pane for the
  selected group. In the browse mode you are able to create new group in the album, to add, delete and edit pictures in
  a group, to drag-and-drop pictures across the groups as well as perform some additional operations.

{[%hh_h2:View mode]}
<p>That would be slightly strange if picture-arranging program doesn't have some functional tool for
  viewing them. In PhoA this mode allows viewing single pictures (source, ie. ones on that thumbnails are
  created). Viewing supports image scaling (zooming in/out) and scrolling it, advancing to the next, previous, the first
  and the next picture in the group, switching between full-screen and window modes.
