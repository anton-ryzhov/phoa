{[%hh_hdr_en:Common tasks :: Using external tools]}

<p>PhoA is capable of attaching external programs to use for viewing, printing or processing of the
  photo album pictures.

<p>This is implemented with so-called <b>tools</b>, which you create and configure.

<p>There is a variety of tool kinds.

<p>The majority of tool kinds is represented by so-called <b>default actions</b>. Additionally, there's a
  possibility of using an arbitrary program as a custom tool.

{[%hh_h2:Default actions]}

<p>It is a sort of &quot;simplified&quot; tool kinds.

<p>As is known, Windows introduces a concept of <i>file type</i>, which unambiguously linked to the file's
  extension. For instance, files with extension <b>.doc</b> are of type &quot;Microsoft Word document&quot;, while
  <b>.html</b> files are Internet documents.

<p>Most registered file types (at least document types) in Windows have an associated <i>application</i>,
  which opens the files of that type when you run them from the Explorer. This is how works the <i>default action</i>
  for that type of file. So, .doc files are open in Microsoft Word, while .html files are handled by the default
  browser.

<p>Just such a behaviour is implemented by the <b>Default action</b> tool kind.

<p>Besides there's a number of other standard actions, namely:

<ul>
  <li>open;
  <li>edit;
  <li>print.
</ul>

<p>Each of those actions has a corresponding tool kind.

<p>Any of the actions listed above may be customized by you using standard Windows tools. You do it by
  selecting the <b>Tools | Folder options...</b> Explorer menu item, on the <b>File types page</b>.

<p>Many graphic applications (such as graphic editors or viewers; but not PhoA) change file
  associations to open with themselves. Some of them confirm before making such changes.

<p>Therefore if you are happy with your current file associations you will likely use just those standard
  tool kinds.

<p>There's one more subtle advantage of standard actions over custom ones (described below). The point is
  that standard actions in Windows often use so-called DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) commands, which allow opening several
  pictures by the same application at once, while custom tools often spawn a new application instance for each picture.
  The latter case is less convenient.

{[%hh_h2:Custom action]}

<p>This kind of tool allows for specifying any program to open (or process) a certain type of files. In
  most case it will be a graphic editor or a viewer. However you can also use more specific tools like a batch image
  converter.

{[%hh_h2:Separator item]}

<p>It is a most unpretentious tool kind used to create menu separators.

<p>Well that's all for tool kinds. Let's now pass on to

{[%hh_h2:Tool masks]}

<p>To describe image types for which a tool is applicable to, each tool in PhoA has a so-called
  <i>mask</i>. Mask writing rules are similar to respective Windows rules, and the masks are used in many cases in the
  program. Read <a href="info-file-masks.html">here</a> for detailed explanation of mask writing rules.

<p>A tool becomes available only when <i>all</i> selected pictures match its mask (masks to be precise as
  a tool can have assigned a number of masks).

{[%hh_h2:Tool usage]}

<p>In order to make a tool useful you should be able to execute it. PhoA tools can appear in
  various menus. You configure that in tool's <a href="info-tools.html">properties</a>.

{[%hh_h2:Custom action settings]}

<p>Ut supra, custom actions require specifying a program, and some additional parameters. Minute
  information about tool properties is <a href="info-tools.html#usages">here</a>.

<p>That program is passed the full picture file path as a command line parameter. Most image processing
  applications take input file names in such a way.
