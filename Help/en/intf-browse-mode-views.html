  <h2><img src="../h2-bullet.gif" align=absmiddle width=10 height=10> Introduction</h2>
  <p align=justify>Photo album <b>views</b> look similar to photo album group tree, the only difference is that groups are being created by you
    while view's folder hierarchy is built automatically based on picture data as well as on <b>groupings</b> you provide. A grouping is one
    logical unit of view's organzation, and it may form one or more folder tree levels. When generating view's folder hierarchy, <i>each</i>
    picture is arranged into some group, which is determined by the view properties to be seen below.

  <h2><img src="../h2-bullet.gif" align=absmiddle width=10 height=10> View properties</h2>
  <p align=justify>As you can see in <a href="intf-view-props.html">View properties dialog</a>, the view has name, the list of groupings and the
    list of sortings.

  <h3>View name</h3>
  <p align=justify>The name is specified by you, and it reflects the view's content, eg, &quot;By place and date&quot;.
  
  <h3>List of groupings</h3>  
  <p align=justify>The grouping list is to be seen more detailed. <b>PhoA</b> supports the following grouping kinds:
  <ul>
    <li><b>By picture file path</b><br>
      Pictures are arranged into folders according to their physical locations</li>
    <li><b>By date year</b><br>
      Pictures are grouped into folders, each of which contains pictures with the same year. This grouping supports <a href="#unclassified">arranging
      unclassified pictures into separate folder</a></li>
    <li><b>By date month</b><br>
      Pictures are grouped into folders, each of which contains pictures with the same month. Usually it is worth to apply this grouping after the 
      grouping by date year, in this case you'll have year folders containing folders for months of that year; but you may apply this grouping alone,
      this way pictures will be grouped by the month, but still with different years. This grouping supports <a href="#unclassified">arranging
      unclassified pictures into separate folder</a></li>
    <li><b>By date day</b><br>
      Pictures are grouped into folders, each of which contains pictures with the same day of the month. Usually it is worth to apply this grouping
      after the groupings by date year and by date month, in this case you'll have year folders containing folders for months of that year, and they in
      turn will contain folders for days of that month; but you may apply this grouping alone, this way pictures will be grouped by day of the month,
      but still with different years and months. This grouping supports <a href="#unclassified">arranging unclassified pictures into separate
      folder</a></li>
    <li><b>By time hour</b><br>
      Pictures are grouped into folders, each of which contains pictures with the same hour (taken from picture's time). This grouping supports
      <a href="#unclassified">arranging unclassified pictures into separate folder</a></li>
    <li><b>By time minute</b><br>
      Pictures are grouped into folders, each of which contains pictures with the same minute (taken from picture's time). Usually it is worth
      to apply this grouping after the grouping by time hour, in this case you'll have year folders containing folders for minutes of that hour;
      but you may apply this grouping alone, this way pictures will be grouped by the minute, but still with different hours. This grouping
      supports <a href="#unclassified">arranging unclassified pictures into separate folder</a></li>
    <li><b>By place</b><br>
      Pictures are arranged into folders by their place. This grouping supports <a href="#unclassified">arranging unclassified pictures into separate
      folder</a></li>
    <li><b>By film number</b><br>
      Pictures are arranged into folders by their film number. This grouping supports <a href="#unclassified">arranging unclassified pictures into
      separate folder</a></li>
    <li><b>By author</b><br>
      Pictures are arranged into folders by their author. This grouping supports <a href="#unclassified">arranging unclassified pictures into separate
      folder</a></li>
    <li><b>By media name or code</b><br>
      Pictures are arranged into folders by their media. This grouping supports <a href="#unclassified">arranging unclassified pictures into separate
      folder</a></li>
    <li><b>By keywords</b><br>
      Pictures are arranged into folders by their keywords. Accordingly, one picture may participate in some folders, and it'll do if it contains
      some keywords. This grouping supports <a href="#unclassified">arranging unclassified pictures into separate folder</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>List of sortings</h3>
  <p align=justify>After pictures are arranged into folders they reside there, as rule, in random order, and that's inconvenient; moreover, you cannot
    reorder them manually. To fix this there's a possibility in <b>PhoA</b> to sort grouping results in each group with use of sortings. You do this
    just like when you <a href="intf-sort-pics.html">sort pictures</a> in the photo album.
  
  <h2><img src="../h2-bullet.gif" align=absmiddle width=10 height=10> <a name="unclassified">Arranging unclassified pictures into separate folder</a></h2>
  <p align=justify>As you know, this is not mandatory to completely describe a picture. But since when generating a view each picture is processed
    and is included into the view (see above), there are two choices how to handle pictures having no data for the given grouping criteria (no date
    when grouping by date, no place when grouping by place etc):
  <ul>
    <li>If the grouping has &quot;Unclassified pictures in own folder&quot; checkbox checked, they will be put into the appropriate folder
        (&quot;No date&quot;, &quot;No place&quot; etc) located at the same tree level as the rest of folders, and just at the top of the level.</li>
    <li>If the checkbox is unchecked, pictures with no data will be leaved in the former folder, and no additional folder is created for them. So,
        given the grouping by date (checkbox is unchecked), the picture remains in the root folder (the folder corresponding to the view itself),
        and if you then apply the grouping by place (checkbox is checked), the &quot;No place&quot; folder will reside in the root directory,
        and the picture will be placed there, while the rest of folders (with place specified) will be created under the date folders; thus picture
        classification by place will reside on different folder tree levels.</li>
  </ul>
  <p align=justify>This feature (obvious) is not applicable with grouping by picture file path since there are no pictures with no files, and there are
    no files without paths (at least I've heard nothing of it ;).

  <h2><img src="../h2-bullet.gif" align=absmiddle width=10 height=10> Copying view's folders to the photo album</h2>
  <p align=justify><b>PhoA</b> also introduces the possibility for copying generated folder and picture structure as ordinary photo album groups.
    For this you select <b>View | Views | Make a group...</b> menu item, then <a href="intf-sel-phoa-group.html">Select a group dialog</a> appears,
    allowing you to select a group to place view's folders to.
