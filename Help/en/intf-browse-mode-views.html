{[%hh_h2:Introduction]}
<p align=justify>Photo album <b>views</b> look similar to photo album group tree, the only difference is that groups are
  being created by you while view's folder hierarchy is built automatically based on picture data as well as on
  <b>groupings</b> you provide. A grouping is one logical unit of view's organzation, and it may form one or more folder
  tree levels. When generating view's folder hierarchy, <i>each picture passed through the
  <a href=#filter_expr>filter</a></i> is arranged into some group, which is determined by the view properties to be seen
  below.

{[%hh_h2:View properties]}
<p align=justify>As you can see in <a href="intf-view-props.html">View properties dialog</a>, the view has name, the
  list of groupings and the list of sortings.

{[%hh_h2:Controls]}

<table class=plain border=0>

    <td class=command>View name</td>
    <td>The name is specified by you, and it reflects the view's content, eg, &quot;By place and date&quot;.</td>

    <td class=command>List of groupings</td>

      <b>PhoA</b> supports the following grouping kinds:
      <ul>
        <li><b>By picture file path</b><br>
            Pictures are arranged into folders according to their physical locations.
        <li><b>By date year</b><br>
            Pictures are grouped into folders, each of which contains pictures with the same year. This grouping
            supports arranging <a href="#unclassified">unclassified</a> pictures into a separate folder.
        <li><b>By date month</b><br>
            Pictures are grouped into folders, each of which contains pictures with the same month. Usually it is worth
            to apply this grouping after the grouping by date year, in this case you'll have year folders containing
            folders for months of that year; but you may apply this grouping alone, this way pictures will be grouped by
            the month, but still with different years. This grouping supports arranging
            <a href="#unclassified">unclassified</a> pictures into a separate folder.
        <li><b>By date day</b><br>
            Pictures are grouped into folders, each of which contains pictures with the same day of the month. Usually
            it is worth to apply this grouping after the groupings by date year and by date month, in this case you'll
            have year folders containing folders for months of that year, and they in turn will contain folders for days
            of that month; but you may apply this grouping alone, this way pictures will be grouped by day of the month,
            but still with different years and months. This grouping supports arranging
            <a href="#unclassified">unclassified</a> pictures into a separate folder.
        <li><b>By time hour</b><br>
            Pictures are grouped into folders, each of which contains pictures with the same hour (taken from picture's
            time). This grouping supports arranging <a href="#unclassified">unclassified</a> pictures into a separate
            folder.
        <li><b>By time minute</b><br>
            Pictures are grouped into folders, each of which contains pictures with the same minute (taken from
            picture's time). Usually it is worth to apply this grouping after the grouping by time hour, in this case
            you'll have year folders containing folders for minutes of that hour; but you may apply this grouping alone,
            this way pictures will be grouped by the minute, but still with different hours. This grouping supports
            arranging <a href="#unclassified">unclassified</a> pictures into a separate folder.
        <li><b>By place</b><br>
            Pictures are arranged into folders by their place. This grouping supports arranging
            <a href="#unclassified">unclassified</a> pictures into a separate folder.
        <li><b>By film number</b><br>
            Pictures are arranged into folders by their film number. This grouping supports arranging
            <a href="#unclassified">unclassified</a> pictures into a separate folder.
        <li><b>By author</b><br>
            Pictures are arranged into folders by their author. This grouping supports arranging
            <a href="#unclassified">unclassified</a> pictures into a separate folder.
        <li><b>By media name or code</b><br>
            Pictures are arranged into folders by their media. This grouping supports arranging
            <a href="#unclassified">unclassified</a> pictures into a separate folder.
        <li><b>By keywords</b><br>
            Pictures are arranged into folders by their keywords. Accordingly, one picture may participate in some
            folders, and it'll do if it contains some keywords. This grouping supports arranging
            <a href="#unclassified">unclassified</a> pictures into a separate folder.
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>List of sortings</td>
    <td>After pictures are arranged into folders they reside there, as rule, in random order, and that's inconvenient;
        moreover, you cannot reorder them manually. To fix this there's a possibility in <b>PhoA</b> to sort grouping
        results in each group with use of sortings. You do this just like when you <a href="intf-sort-pics.html">sort
        pictures</a> in the photo album.</td>
  </tr>

{[%hh_h2:<a name=unclassified></a>Arranging unclassified pictures into a separate folder]}
<p align=justify>As you know, this is not mandatory to completely describe a picture. But since when generating a view
  each picture passed the <a href=#filter_expr>filter</a> is processed and included into the view (see above), there are
  two choices how to handle pictures having no data for the given grouping criteria (no date when grouping by date, no
  place when grouping by place etc.):
<ul>
  <li>If a grouping has &quot;Unclassified pictures in own folder&quot; checkbox checked, they will be put into the
      appropriate folder (&quot;No date&quot;, &quot;No place&quot; etc.) located at the same tree level as the rest of
      folders, and just at the top of the level.
  <li>If the checkbox is unchecked, pictures with no data will be leaved in the former folder, and no additional folder
      is created for them. So, given the grouping by date (checkbox is unchecked), the picture remains in the root
      folder (the folder corresponding to the view itself), and if you then apply the grouping by place (checkbox is
      checked), the &quot;No place&quot; folder will reside in the root directory, and the picture will be placed there,
      while the rest of folders (with place specified) will be created under the date folders; thus picture
      classification by place will reside on different folder tree levels.
</ul>
<p align=justify>This feature (obvious) is not applicable for the grouping by picture file path since there are no
  pictures with no files, and there are no files without paths (at least I've heard nothing of it ;).

{[%hh_h2:<a name=filter_expr></a>Picture filter expression]}
<p align=justify>You are able to restrict the list of images placed to the view. You do it using
  <a href="intf-expr-editor.html">Filter expression editor</a> the way like in <a href="intf-search-expr.html">Exprssion
  search</a>. If no filter expression specified, the view will contain <b>all</b> photo album pictures.

{[%hh_h2:Copying view's folders to the photo album]}
<p align=justify><b>PhoA</b> also introduces the possibility for copying generated folder and picture structure as
  ordinary photo album groups. For this you select <b>View | Views | Make a group...</b> menu item, then
  <a href="intf-sel-phoa-group.html">Select a group dialog</a> appears, allowing you to select a group to place view's
  folders to.
