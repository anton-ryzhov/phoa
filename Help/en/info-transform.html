{[%hh_hdr_en:Transformations]}

<p>The current <b>PhoA</b> version supports socalled <b>nondestructive</b> transformations ie
  transformations that do not modify the source image files. Such transformations are being applied immediately before
  the image is viewed, in the memory.
<p>The specified transformations are applied in the predefined order:
<ol>
  <li><a href="#rotation">Rotation</a>
  <li><a href="#flips">Flips</a> (or mirror)
</ol>
<p>You can apply transformations while <a href="intf-view-mode.html">viewing</a> or beforehand, in the
  <a href="intf-pic-props-view.html">picture properties dialog</a>. Additionally, you can store the transformations you
  specify during viewing into the picture properties, by using the <b>Store transformations</b> command.
<p>The transformations stored in the picture properties also affect how the thumbnail is displayed as the
  same transformations are applied to it.

<h3><a name=rotation>Rotation</a></h3>
<p>The program allows for rotating the pictures by multiples of 90&deg;. This makes possible eg viewing
  the images taken with the camera rotated relative to source position.

<h3><a name=flips>Flips</a></h3>
<p>The two flip kinds are implemented: horizontal (along the vertical axis) and vertical (along the
  horizontal axis).
