{[%hh_h2:Why burn?]}

<p><b>PhoA</b> simplifies preparing files to have them burned on a removable media, like CD, DVD, Flash
  Disk or whatever else.

<div class=nb><b>NB:</b> The program has no CD or DVD <i>writing facility</i>. It only allows to make a file and folder
  layout which will be handy to write onto a removable media. To make the latter you will need an appropriate software.
</div>

<p>One can distinguish the two major file copying goals: (<b>1</b>) creating a backup copy of the image
  archive or simply an image disk and (<b>2</b>) creating a full-fledged photo album disk.

<p>The former case assumes the disk contains only folders and image files organized in a desired way.

<p>The latter case means the disk also contains a number of additional files: a photo album containing
  the copied image files, the main <b>PhoA</b> executable, a file with current program settings and so forth.

<p>Let's start with the former case as it's a part of the latter one.

{[%hh_h2:Preparing image files to recording on a removable media]}

<ol>
  <li>For a start you should decide which pictures will be placed to the media:
      <ul>
        <li>If you wish to write only selected pictures, then select them in the thumbnail window.
        <li>If you wish to write all of the pictures belonging to a group, then select that group in the tree.
        <li>If you wish to write a number of groups, you don't need to do something special as you will select them
            later.
      </ul>

  <li>Start the <b>File operations wizard</b>. You do it by selecting the <b>{[%hh_ii:FileOps]} Tools | File
      operations...</b> menu item.

  <li>On the first page of the wizard check <b>Copy picture files to a folder</b> and click <b>Next</b>.

  <li>It's just the time now to specify which picture files are to be copied. For first and second choices of
      <b>item&nbsp;1</b> an appropriate selection should already be made. For the third choice, i.&nbsp;e. selecting a
      number of groups at once, check the required groups.
      <p><b>Please note</b> the <i>total picture file size</i> denoted at the bottom of the page: it
      shouldn't be greater than available media size. Moreover, if you plan to have the program file also be included,
      leave about 10 MByte + estimated photo album file size of free space.

  <li>On the next page you will have to specify the <b>destination folder</b> for copied files. Select an empty folder
      (you can type in a nonexistent folder name, in that case it will be created automatically).

  <li>Configure the file arranging mode. Refer to the <a href="intf-file-ops-moveopts.html">manual</a> for a detailed
      explanation of each of the choices. Have in mind though that, firstly, physical file layout does not mean much to
      the program, and, secondly, the most simple option will be putting all of the files into a single folder. In the
      latter case you will have to ensure that file names are unique, and the simplest way to achieve this is enabling
      file renaming provided picture ID included in the file name format. By the way, any format containing {ID} (for
      instance, <b>Image_{ID}</b> ), provides uniqueness across all of the images.

  <li>On the last page you should denote which behavior the program will use when a problem occurs. If you don't need
      creating additional files, uncheck the <b>Set up CD/DVD creation options as well</b> check box. After you click
      <b>Next</b> the program will start copying of the files.
</ol>


{[%hh_h2:Preparing additional files to recording on a removable media]}

<p>Now the second case: a full-fledged photo album disk. This time you <i>don't need</i> to uncheck the
  <b>Set up CD/DVD creation options as well</b> check box. Then after clicking <b>Next</b> you will be offered a number
  of options to configure which special files are to be included in the removable media. Detailed description of each
  option is in the <a href="intf-file-ops-cdopts.html">manual</a>.

{[%hh_h2:Done?]}

<p>To place files to a removable media correctly (it is especially important for the second case), you
  should do the following:

<ol>
  <li>Launch your CD/DVD burning software.
  <li>Select a <b>Data CD/DVD</b> mode (or similar, consult your burning software manual for details).
  <li>Place the whole <i>content</i> of the destionation folder selected before (but not the folder itself!) to the root
      directory of the disk.
  <li>Burn the media. That's all.
</ol>
