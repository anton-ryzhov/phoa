{[%hh_hdr_en:Add pictures wizard :: Addition log]}

<p align=justify>The log displays all the operations performed to the picture files, in sequence. Each file (from selected ones) may be marked
  either as succeeded, or as failed, the latter case the error encountered message appears next to the file name. In the former case the
  autofill results described.

<h3>Display errors only</h3>
<p align=justify>When turned on the log shows only failed entries, otherwise succeeded entries are also shown. The option is convenient when
  you need to find some errors among a large number of added files.

<h3>Save to file...</h3>
<p align=justify>Allows you to write the log to a plain text file.
<div class=nb><b>NB:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>When saving the log <i>all</i> entries are always written, disregarding the <b>Display errors only</b> checkbox.</li>
    <li>Failed entries are marked with symbols <b>[!]</b> in the file, while succeeded ones have <b>[+]</b> at the beginning. This allows to
        easily find errors in the log file unless you use to include these characters in file names.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p align=justify>The popup menu (accessible with right mouse click) supplies additional options:

<h3>Copy</h3>
<p align=justify>Copies the line currently selected into the clipboard.

<h3>Find...</h3>
<p align=justify>Displays standard Find text dialog allowing you to search through the log list, eg. for a particular file name.

<p align=justify>You can watch the log before all files are added by interrupting the addition process and then clicking then <b>Next</b>
  button. Afterwards you can go back (by clicking <b>Back</b>) and then resume the process.
