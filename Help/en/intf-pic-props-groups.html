{[%hh_hdr_en:Edit pictures dialog :: Groups]}

<p align=justify>At this page you can graphically view groups that pictures belong to. Moreover you can easily add or remove multiple pictures
  to or from the multiple groups.
<p align=justify>Similarly to <a href="intf-pic-props-keywords.html">keywords</a> changes are being made by toggling the entries' checkboxes,
  and numbers in parentheses also have the similar meaning: one number means number of pictures in the group; if two numbers are divided by slash
  then the first is the number of selected pictures in this group, and the second is the total number of pictures in it.
<p align=justify>Checkbox also acts like for keywords: if no one of the selected pictures is contained in a group, the the checkbox appears clear.
  If some of the selected pictures are contained, and the rest are not, the checkbox will be grayed. And if all of the selected pictures are in the
  group, then the checkmox will be checked.
<p align=justify>Feel free to develop this on your own.

<div class=nb><b>NB:</b> you <b>cannot</b> check pictures so that some pictures are completely out of groups - this might requre to delete
  these pictures, but picture deletion is just different operation. Thus <b>PhoA</b> disables such operation notifying you of the situation.
