{[%hh_hdr_en:Common tasks :: Rotating pictures]}

<p align=justify>Images taken with a digital still camera are often rotated inappropriately: they are rotated by
  90&deg; or even by 180&deg;. To preserve you from twisting your neck and from putting your monitor to a side,
  <b>PhoA</b> allows you to rotate pictures by multiplies of 90&deg; (i.e. by 90&deg;, 180&deg; or 270&deg;),
  immediately when you view them.

<div class=nb><b>NB:</b> The program allows for performing a so-called <i>nondestructive rotation</i> of a picture,
  i.&nbsp;e. a rotation applied &quot;on the fly&quot;, immediately before it gets displayed. Due to this the
  corresponding picture file remains unchanged.
  <p align=justify>What for this was done in this way? The reason is that most digital still cameras store photos in
  <i>lossy formats</i> (the most commonly used one is JPEG). A picture compressed in such a format loses quality each
  time it is saved to a disk file. Resulting difference between the original image and an image saved 2 or 3 times may
  be noticeable, especially when it is printed.
  <p align=justify>So nondestructive rotation ensures a maximum quality closest to the original image.
</div>

{[%hh_h2:Picture rotation during viewing]}

<p align=justify>You can rotate a picture immediately when you <a href="tasks-viewing.html">view</a> it. In order to
  perform this click one of the buttons on the <b>Transformations</b> toolbar, or select an appropriate item from the
  <b>Tools | Transformations</b> menu. You will see the result instantly.

<p align=justify>However, the rotation you have applied isn't stored automatically to the picture, so when you view it
  next time it will be oriented just as before.

<p align=justify>If you wish the picture to keep the applied rotation permanently, select the <b>Tools | Transformations
  | Store transformations</b> menu item.

<p align=justify>You also can apply the same rotation to a number of pictures at once directly in the browse mode. Just
  do the following:

<ol>
  <li>Select all pictures you want to rotate using left mouse button and <b>Shift</b> and <b>Ctrl</b>
      <a href="intf-ctl-browser-key.html">keys</a>.
  <li>Open the Picture properties dialog using the <b>Edit | Edit...</b> menu item.
  <li>In the dialog switch to the <b>View &amp; Adjust</b> page.
  <li>Choose a rotation using toolbar buttons or with items of the context menu appearing when you right-click the
      image.
  <li>Save the changes by clicking <b>OK</b>.
</ol>
