{[%hh_hdr_en:Program settings :: View mode]}

<h3>View window always on top</h3>
<p align=justify>Does not allow the window to fall behind other windows when it's inactive. Affects only the window mode.

<h3>Fullscreen mode</h3>
<p align=justify>When entering view mode the program will set up the fullscreen mode when all other screen elements are hidden
  (including the Taskbar). This can be overriden with the <b>F</b> key or by clicking middle mouse button.

<h3>Keep mouse cursor over the toolbar button on window resize</h3>
<p align=justify>If on, the mouse cursor stays at the same point of the viewer toolbar when the window resizes. This allows you to
  click buttons (such as <b>Next picture</b> or <b>Zoom out</b>) multiple times without having to move the mouse.

<h3>Hide mouse cursor in fullscreen</h3>
<p align=justify>When entering fullscreen mode the program will turn off mouse pointer.

<h3>Window background color</h3>
<p align=justify>Determines color for filling the viewing window background. The default is black.

<h3>Show toolbar</h3>
<p align=justify>Enables or disables view mode toolbar.

  <p align=justify>Resizes window so that it fits the picture (considering current scale). Affects only the window mode.

  <h3>Center window on the desktop</h3>
  <p align=justify>Places viewing window in the center of the desktop. Affects only the window mode.

  <h3>Cyclic viewing</h3>
  <p align=justify>If on, the viewing sequence wraps around.

  <h3>Predecode next picture in advance</h3>
  <p align=justify>This option enables background picture decoding thus allowing quick advancing to the next picture (next picture is being decoded
    while viewing current one). This mode requires more memory for storing predecoded image data.

  <h3>Cache behind viewed pictures</h3>
  <p align=justify>If this option is enabled, last viewed picture is not removed from the memory thus allowing you to quckly revert to previous
    picture. This mode requires more memory for storing cached image data.
