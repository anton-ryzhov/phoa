{[%hh_h2:A number of pictures at once]}
<p>PhoA supports editing picture data for any number of pictures simultaneously. For this page the
  following simple scheme used:
<ul>
  <li>If some property is <b>the same</b> across all the selected pictures, then the corresponding entry field will be
      of white color (or of window color to be precise).
  <li>If a property's values <b>differ</b> between selected pictures, the corresponding field will be of gray color (or
      of 3D-objects' color). If you change this field's data the property will be synced for all selected pictures, and
      the field will become white. Otherwise the property values will remain unchanged (and different,
      respectively).
</ul>
<p>You may <a href="intf-search.html">search pictures</a> by these data afterwards.
