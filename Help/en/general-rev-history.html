    <ul>
      <li>A possibility for using the fast JPEG decoding library IJL (Intel JPEG Library) as a plugin. When ijl15.dll is
          present in Plugins directory, the program automatically utilizes it for decoding JPEG files which results in
          speed increase up to 300%.</li>
      <li>Many optimizations to thumbnail creating mechanism which benefits even more from using IJL and results in just
          a crazy thumbnail rebuilding speed.</li>
      <li>Andrew Dudko has written initial expression parser routines; this allowed to implement a brand-new picture
          search interface with using filter expressions.</li>
      <li>The same expression can now be used to filter pictures in a view.</li>
      <li>The former search interface is also available (now called <b>Simple search</b>). A possibility of adding an
          arbitrary number of criteria by any properties of a picture.</li>
      <li>New searchable/displayable picture properties: thumbnail width, height and dimensions.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Completely reworked program localization mechanism. All you need to do to add a new interface language is
          place a transaltion file into the Language folder. The translation file itself is a plain text one, accessible
          with any text editor; but you are strongly recommended to use <b>DKLang Translation Editor</b> (available on
          the site) for this purpose since it provides a number of additional, translation-specific features.</li>
      <li>About 80% rewrite of internal program design. This might affect the number of bugs ;)</li>
      <li>Undo data are now stored to the disk, not to memory. This allowed to increase the default undo buffer size to
          100 operations.</li>
      <li>Thumbnail window: smooth scrolling; <b>Ctrl+Arrows/PgUp/PgDn/Home/End</b> now moves the focus leaving the
          selection intact; <b>Shift+Alt+Arrows/PgUp/PgDn/Home/End</b> creates rectangular selection;
          <b>Space/Ctrl+Space</b> toggles focused thumbnail selection; <b>Ctrl+Mouse wheel</b> scrolls one screen per
          detent.</li>
      <li>Enabled file drag'n'drop into the group tree.</li>
      <li>New resampling filters: <b>Draft</b> (more precise than Nearest neighbor but significantly faster than
          Bilinear/Bicubic) and <b>Cosine</b>.</li>
      <li>Additional thumbnail appearance settings: thumbnail background border style and color.</li>
      <li>A possibility of Picture properties dialog default page selection.</li>
      <li>A possibility of picture data editing while a view is active.</li>
      <li>Thumbnail caching in the Browse mode is no longer pertinent. Things showed it caused big problems under
          Win9x.</li>
      <li>Pressing the <b>Enter</b> key in the Browse mode when thumbnail window is active starts viewing of the current
          picture. Pressing <b>Shift+Ctrl+Enter</b> enters the View mode and starts slide show.</li>
      <li>Pressing the <b>Enter</b> key in the View mode exits back to the Browse mode provided the last viewed picture
          is selected in the thumbnails window.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Copying files of selected pictures</b> into single folder / maintaining original folder layout
              relatively to specified folder / maintaining picture group hierarchy relatively to specified group (incl.

    <ul>
      <li>Photo album file format changed - now it is very expandable and meant not to be changed frequently.</li>
      <li>Modifications to folder tree appearance:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Views</b> toolbar has been removed. Instead of it there is now a dropdown button beside the photo album
              node invoking views menu.</li>
          <li>Pictures are now can be placed directly to the photo album node, having no group created.</li>
          <li>Number of images is displayed beside the group name.</li>
          <li>Altered Drag'n'Drop functioning: to insert a node as a sibling of another node (above or below), you'll
              have to drag the node to the free area on the right side of nodes, and then the insertion point is drawn
              as a line. To make a node a child of another node you drag this node right over the target node, then the
              target node gets highlighted. There's no more Shift button used (i mean while dragging ;)</li>
          <li>When a node is being dragged the target node expands if you leave mouse over the target for a time. Also
              when mouse rests near the top or bottom edge (while dragging) the group tree starts to scroll.</li>
          <li>Cosmetic changes (root items are drawn bold, Drag'n'Drop uses blended source folder image etc.)</li>
          <li>Lists are adjustable.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Picture adding and editing have been completely separated. The goal was to remove compromises in the
          interface. Pictures are always being added with the defaults, you may edit them afterwards.</li>
      <li>Changes to the Add pictures dialog:
        <ul>
          <li>The dialog became the wizard. On the first stage you select picture files and/or folder, on the second one
              you may exactly determine which files are to be added.</li>
          <li>When adding pictures you can filter them by photo album presence, by name or extension, by date/time file
              modified.</li>
          <li>Picture addition is performed in the separate thread which has improved the response to user actions.</li>
          <li>Addition process is being logged, the log can be saved to a text file.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fully functional support for JPEG-image metadata <b>EXIF 2.1</b> - data placed to image files by almost any
          digicam as well as by modern graphic editors. Metadata can be used for filling some picture properties.</li>
      <li>Many changes to Edit pictures dialog. In a nutshell:
        <ul>
          <li>Dialog became multipaged.</li>
          <li><b>File properties</b> page allows you to view file properties info.</li>
          <li><b>Metadata</b> page displays all the EXIF data contained in JPEG files.</li>
          <li><b>View</b> page enables file viewing for any selected file.</li>
          <li><b>Data</b> page is just a thing that was Edit pictures dialog + new properties.</li>
          <li><b>Keywords</b> page allows you to modify keyword list by adding, removing and editing single keywords for
              any number of pictures at once.</li>
          <li><b>Groups</b> page shows photo album group tree in which you can easily determine groups pictures belong
              to, or change these belongings.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Program settings were extended aloud.</li>
      <li>You may now reorder pictures inside group using Drag'n'Drop (in the thumbnails pane).</li>
      <li>Views now support automated sorting the pictures inside each group.</li>
      <li>Thumbnail pane always selects the first thumbnail by default.</li>
      <li>Undo history dialog has been removed: now you can undo any number of changes by clicking the dropdown button
          near the <b>Undo</b> toolbar button or with <b>Edit | Undo history</b> submenu.</li>
      <li>All other trees displaying picture groups also have been altered - now they all look like the main tree.</li>
      <li>The status bar displays the total number of distinct pictures in the photo album.</li>
      <li>Local toolbar in the view mode.</li>

      <li>By a lot of complaints against thumbnail quality there's resampling filtering option to eliminate shrinked
          picture's fuzziness. Possible filters are: Nearest Neighbor, Linear, B-spline (bicubic), Lanczos, Mitchell. As
          a side effect, owing to some smoothing of the thumbnail, its size (because of JPEG-compression) reduced by 10
          thru 25% (eg, when using B-spline interpolation the decrease is 20-25%).</li>
      <li>Significantly increased speed of rescaling and scrolling pictures. In the view mode you can also choose any of
          the resampling filters listed above.</li>
      <li>Added option for decoding pictures in background: a separate thread is responsible for decoding the next
          picture while you are watching current one. This technique minimizes time required to advance to the next
          picture (but requires more memory).</li>
      <li>Added option for caching-behind viewed pictures, which minimizes time to rewind to the previous picture (but
          also takes more memory).</li>
      <li>The support for <b>.gif</b> files was not included. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Added support for <b>.msk</b> (Paint Shop Pro mask), <b>.tub</b> (Paint Shop Pro picture tube), <b>.pfr</b>
          (Paint Shop Pro picture frame) file formats.</li>
      <li>View info painting is completely changed. Now information is always positioned over the picture, optionally on
          a translucent background, and you can visually position information bar.</li>

    <p align=justify>Huge number of differences resulted in program version and time taken to release it.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Views!</b> Completely new picture arranging algorithm. Now you can classify a heap of pictures into folders
          with minimum efforts. The only requirement is that pictures' properties are properly filled. Possible grouping
          conditions are: by picture file path, by date (in various ways), by place, by keywords etc. Groupings may be
          cascaded, ie may be applied one by one, number of groupings is a matter of sanity. The result of the grouping
          (folder tree along with their pictures) may be easily put into any photo album group, and after then you can
          tweak them in usual way.</li>
      <li>Photo album file (.phoa) format has been changed. Photo album files since version 1.0.1a contain views' data,
          and they are incompatible with the earlier <b>PhoA</b> versions. The program also supports saving files in
          PhoA 0.x format, which is choosed while saving the file (File | Save as...); accordingly, in this case views
          are not saved.</li>
      <li><b>Sorting</b> now can be performed by any number of criteria; it is organized in the similar way as views'
          groupings. The list of sorting criteria has been significantly extended.</li>
      <li>You can now tweak thumbnail tooltips in Browse mode; you can choose which details are displayed.</li>
      <li>Picture info in View mode is now also more adjustable.</li>
      <li>Three options on <b>toolbar buttons size</b> (small/middle/large).</li>
      <li>Massively extended support for <b>picture file formats</b>. Now almost all possible formats are supported
          (briefly: Windows bitmap (BMP, RLE, DIB), OS/2 bitmap, TIFF, GFI fax, SGI, Autodesk, Truevision Targa, ZSoft
          Paintbrush, Word 5.x, Kodak Photo-CD, Portable pixel/gray map, Dr. Halo CUT, CompuServe GIF, SGI Wavefront,
          Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, Portable network graphic PNG; for details refer to the
          <a href="general-file-formats.html">file formats discussion</a>).</li>
      <li>New algorithms for <b>keyword processing</b> (keywords containing spaces and/or commas are to be quoted; when
          selecting them from the list such keywords are quoted automatically; keywords are no longer converted to
          lowercase in the Select keywords dialog, though keywords are still compared case-insensitively).</li>
