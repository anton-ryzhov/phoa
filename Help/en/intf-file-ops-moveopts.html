      Consider we have selected the following pictures for copy/move operation:
      <ul>
        <li>C:\My documents\Photo album\Spring 1812\pic001.jpg
        <li>C:\My documents\Photo album\Summer 1812\pic002.jpg
        <li>C:\My documents\Photo album\Autumn 1812\pic003.jpg
        <li>C:\My documents\Photo album\Winter 1812\pic004.jpg
        <li>C:\My documents\Photo album\Winter 1812\Moscow\pic005.jpg
      </ul>
      <p>The program automatically finds that the longest common path for all the pictures is
        <b>C:\My documents\Photo album</b>, and places it into the list of possible base folders as well as other valid
        choices: <b>C:\My documents</b> and <b>C:\</b>; the last choice being added is <b>(none)</b>: when you select it
        the drive letter also becomes a folder inside the destination folder.
      <p>Let's assume now we have selected <b>C:\My documents</b> as a base folder, and
        <b>D:\CD-ROM\Disk1</b> as a <a href="intf-file-ops-selfolder.html">destination folder</a>. Once the operation is
        complete we'll have the following set of files:
        <ul>
          <li>D:\CD-ROM\Disk1\Photo album\Spring 1812\pic001.jpg
          <li>D:\CD-ROM\Disk1\Photo album\Summer 1812\pic002.jpg
          <li>D:\CD-ROM\Disk1\Photo album\Autumn 1812\pic003.jpg
          <li>D:\CD-ROM\Disk1\Photo album\Winter 1812\pic004.jpg
          <li>D:\CD-ROM\Disk1\Photo album\Winter 1812\Moscow\pic005.jpg
        </ul>
      <p>The program takes <b>D:\CD-ROM\Disk1</b> as a start point, and each picture file will have folder
        <b>Photo album</b> in its path as the path is relative to <b>C:\My documents</b>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>Arrange files into folders maintaining group layout</td>
    <td>This mode causes PhoA to arrange files into folders duplicating the existing picture group hierarchy in
        the photo album or <a href="intf-browse-mode-views.html">view</a> (depends on what is active at the
        moment).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>Use path relative to group</td>
    <td>This list allows you to specify the start group from which the program copies the folder structure. The group
        most distant from the root (photo album or <a href="intf-browse-mode-views.html">view</a>), which is the common
        parent for all the <a href="intf-file-ops-selpics.html">selected</a> picture groups, is selected by default (so
        if the photo album node itself is selected for the operation, or you have selected <i>the whole</i> photo album,
        the list will contain the only <b>Photo album</b> item). Also the list is populated with all the parent groups
        of that group including the ultimate parent of all the groups: <i>Photo album</i> or <i>current view</i>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>Allow multiple copies of the file</td>
    <td>As PhoA allows linking a picture to multiple groups, the copy operation maintaining group layout may
        require to place multiple copies of a file into different folders. If this check box is on the program will act
        just this way, otherwise the file will be copied only once (into the first folder in traversal path).</td>

    <td colspan=2>
      <b>File naming</b><br>
      These options specify target file naming algorithms being used.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>Rename files using format</td>
    <td>When this option is enabled the program provides file name for each picture formatted as specified in the edit
        box. Format rules are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Curly brace characters <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> have special meaning: they enclose <b>picture property
              names</b> which serve as placeholders for picture property values. Picture property names are the same as
              ones used for <a href="info-filter-expr.html#pic_props">picture filter expressions</a> except that they
              aren't prepended with dollar sign (<b>$</b>). Property names are case insensitive.<br>
              <b>Note</b> that you cannot use <i>FullFileName</i> and <i>FilePath</i> picture properties in file name
              format as those properties contain file path while we're only dealing with file name here.<br>
              Currently, there's no way to include a literal curly brace in file name format.
          <li>You cannot use any of the characters forbidden in file names (see below which exactly).
          <li>All other characters are treated as literals and copied verbatim to the file name.
        </ul>
        The program always retains the original extension for a file.<br>
        <b>Sample</b> file name formats:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Image_{ID}</b> - files will be named Image_1, Image_2 etc. This method provides unique file names
              because each picture has an unique ID.
          <li><b>{FileName}</b> - files will have the same names as the original ones.
          <li><b>{Date}_{FileName}</b> - each file name will start from picture date and an underscore.
        </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>Replace unallowed symbols with the char</td>
    <td>Specifies a character to replace the unallowed in file or folder names characters with (these are:
        <b>\&nbsp;/&nbsp;:&nbsp;*&nbsp;?&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;|</b>). E.g. if this char is an underscore
        <b>_</b> (default), and a folder should be named <b>Friends/Enemies</b>, then it will have the name
        <b>Friends_Enemies</b>.</td>
