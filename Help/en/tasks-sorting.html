{[%hh_hdr_en:Common tasks :: Sorting pictures]}

<p>Sorting of pictures with reference to <b>PhoA</b> means ordering them by certain criteria.

<div class=nb><b>NB:</b> Each group has its own picture links. Therefore you can have, say, two groups containing the
  same set of pictures but ordered differently.
</div>

<p>The program allows you to order picture by any properties available. The most common case for photos
  is a chronological sequence, that is by date and time.

<p>You can sort pictures either in the current group, or in all photo album groups at once. In order to
  accomplish this:

<ol>
  <li>If you want to sort only one group, select that group in the tree.

  <li>Select the <b>{[%hh_ii:Sort]} Edit | Sort pictures...</b> menu item. This will show the Sort pictures dialog.

  <li>Choose an appropriate option at the <b>Where to sort pictures</b> switch.

  <li>Specify sorting criteria. The dropdown-arrow button allows you to choose a sort property, or to delete a row.
      In order to add a new property, choose it in the last empty row of the table.

  <li>Click <b>OK</b>.
</ol>

<div class=nb><b>NB:</b> Just as above you can sort the <a href="intf-search.html">search</a> results, but in order to
  perform this you should highlight the Search results folder in the group tree and explicitly choose <b>In the current
  group</b>.
</div>
