{[%hh_hdr_en:Purpose of the program]}

<p align=justify>Nowadays it becomes more and more popular to store pictures in an electronic form, as computer
  files. Undoubtedly this way has lots of benefits compare to keeping &quot;hard copies&quot; of photos, drawings etc: an
  electronic picture does not take so much space (a regular recordable CD-R disc can hold as much as about 5000 photos in
  JPEG format of quite good quality), it can be easily duplicated, shown and even presented to all of your and
  others' relatives, pals and enemies (the latter can be achieved by mailing it by email, it could be even better,
  particularly for pictures above 10-20 MB in size).
<p align=justify>Unfortunately some thousands pictures are very hard to search through. The most obvious and simple solution
  might be arranging the files into folders with the appropriate names (&quot;We and our dog&quot;, &quot;Our dog alone&quot;
  etc), but this leads to more and more contradictions: how can you arrange pictures by date and, at once, by subject, by
  event and at the same time by place; how can you attach description to a picture (although some programs allow to write it
  in, they do it pretty difficult); and finally how are you going to find that unique picture of you and your dog where he is
  jumping off 5th floor for you out of that heap of some 1287 pics?
<p align=justify>These tasks seemed unpretentious had emboldened me to write a picture cataloguing program capable of arranging
  and search various pictures (drawings, photos, screenshots and all other stuff).
<p align=justify>Like it or not, but the program's got the name <font color=#324598><b>PhoA</b></font> - an acronym for 'Photo
  Album', and photo album files the program creates also wear extension <b>.phoa</b>.
