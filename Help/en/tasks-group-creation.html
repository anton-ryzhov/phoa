{[%hh_h2:Why create groups?]}

<p>Picture group in PhoA help you to arrange photos by category. You can create a hierarchical
  structure of picture groups like you do it in the Explorer.

<p>To create a group, select a parent group for it from the tree and select the <b>{[%hh_ii:NewGroup]}
  Edit | Add group</b> menu item. A new group will be created inside the selected one, and the program will enter group
  name editing mode. Type in a name for the new group (for example, &quot;My birthday&quot;) and click <b>Enter</b>.

{[%hh_h2:Reordering groups]}

<p>You can change the order in which groups appear in the tree as well as move one group inside another
  one by dragging it with the mouse.

<ul>
  <li>In order to place a group inside another group you should drag it directly <i>onto the latter group's node</i>.
  <li>To place a group near another group drag it to a blank space <i>to the right of the groups</i>. This will display
      an insertion line shaped accordingly to mouse cursor position.
</ul>
