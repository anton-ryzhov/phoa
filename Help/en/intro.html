  <h1><img src="../h1-bullet.gif" align=absmiddle width=22 height=22> Purpose of the program</h1>
  <p align=justify>In the mean time it becomes more and more popular to store pictures in an electronic form, as computer files. Undoubtedly this way
    has lots of benefits compare to keeping &quot;hard copies&quot; of photos, drawings etc: an electronic picture does not take so much space
    (a regular recordable CD-R disc can hold as much as about 5000 photos in JPEG format of quite good quality), it can be easily duplicated,
    shown and even presented at all to all of your and others' relatives, pals and enemies (the latter can be achieved by mailing it by email,
    it could be even better, particularly for pictures above 10-20 MB size).
  <p align=justify>Unfortunately a lot of pictures (those some thousands mentioned above) makes it extremely difficult to find out some. The most obvious
    and simple way is to arrange files into folders with the appropriate names (&quot;We and our dog&quot;, &quot;Our dog alone&quot; etc), but this
    leads to more and more contradictions: how can you arrange pictures by date and, at once, by subject, by event and at the same time by place;
    how can you attach description to a picture (although some programs allow to write it in, they do it pretty difficult); and finally how are you
    going to find that unique picture of you and your dog where he is jumping off 5th floor for you out of that heap of some 1287 pics?
  <p align=justify>These tasks seemed unpretentious had emboldened me to write a picture cataloguing program capable to arrange and search various
    pictures (drawings, photos, screenshots and all other stuff).
  <p align=justify>Like it or not, but the program's got the name <font color=#324598><b>PhoA</b></font> - an acronym for 'Photo Album', and 
    photo album files the program creates also wear extension <b>.phoa</b>.
