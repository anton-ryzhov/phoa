{[%hh_hdr_en:Picture file operations wizard :: Operation log]}

<p align=justify>The log page displays sequentially all the operations performed with the picture files.

<h3>Display errors only</h3>
<p align=justify>When turned on the log shows only failed entries, otherwise succeeded entries are also shown. The option is convenient when
  you need to find some errors among a large number of added files.

<h3>Save to file...</h3>
<p align=justify>Allows you to write the log to a plain text file.
<div class=nb><b>NB:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>When saving the log <i>all</i> entries are always written, disregarding the <b>Display errors only</b> checkbox.</li>
    <li>Failed entries are marked with symbols <b>[!]</b> in the file, while succeeded ones have <b>[+]</b> at the beginning. This allows to
        easily find errors in the log file unless you use to include these characters in file names.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p align=justify>The popup menu (accessible with right mouse click) supplies additional options:

<h3>Copy</h3>
<p align=justify>Copies the line currently selected into the clipboard.

<h3>Find...</h3>
<p align=justify>Displays standard Find text dialog allowing you to search through the log list, eg. for a particular file name.

<p align=justify>You can watch the log before all files are added by interrupting the process and then clicking the <b>Next</b> button.
  Afterwards you can go back (by clicking <b>Back</b>) and then resume the process.
