<p align=justify>The log page displays sequentially all the operations performed with the picture files.

{[%hh_h2:Controls]}

<table class=plain border=0>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>Display errors only</td>
    <td>When turned on the log shows only failed entries, otherwise succeeded entries are also shown. The option is
        convenient when you need to find some errors among a large number of added files.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>Save to file...</td>
    <td>Allows you to write the log to a plain text file.
        <div class=nb><b>NB:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>When saving the log <i>all</i> entries are always written, disregarding the <b>Display errors only</b>
                checkbox.
            <li>Failed entries are marked with symbols <b>[!]</b> in the file, while succeeded ones have <b>[+]</b> at
                the beginning. This allows to easily find errors in the log file unless you use to include these
                characters in file names.
          </ul>
        </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class=tblhdr>
    <td colspan=2>The popup menu (accessible with right mouse click) provides additional options:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>Copy</td>
    <td>Copies the line currently selected into the clipboard.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class=command>Find...</td>
    <td>Displays a standard Find text dialog allowing you to search through the log list, eg. for a particular file
        name.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p align=justify>You can watch the log before all files are added by interrupting the process and then clicking the
  <b>Next</b> button. Afterwards you can go back (by clicking <b>Back</b>) and then resume the process.
