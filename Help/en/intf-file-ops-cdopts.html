{[%hh_hdr_en:Picture file operations wizard :: CD/DVD creation options]}

<p align=justify>This wizard page allows specifying extended options for CD, DVD and other removable media creation for the following file operations:
<ul>
  <li><a href="intf-file-ops-task-copy.html">Copying picture files</a> into a specified folder</li>
  <li><a href="intf-file-ops-task-move.html">Moving picture files</a> into a specified folder</li>
</ul>

<h3>Create a photo album file with selected pictures to</h3>
<p align=justify>If turned on, the program creates a new photo album based on <a href="intf-file-ops-selpics.html">selected groups and pictures</a>,
  and places it in the file specified in the next field.

<h3>Photo album file name</h3>
<p align=justify>Specifies the name of the file to save photo album to (with <b>.phoa</b> extension). The currently open photo album file name is 
  used by default.

<h3>Photo album description</h3>
<p align=justify>Allows you to specify the description for the newly created photo album. The currently open photo album description is used by
  default.

<h3>Also include existing views</h3>
<p align=justify>If on, all the views from the current photo album will be added to the photo album being created.

<h3>Copy the program itself to the destination folder</h3>
<p align=justify>If on, the main program executable (<b>phoa.exe</b>) will also be copied into the <a href="intf-file-ops-selfolder.html">destination
  folder</a>. Since (as <a href="general-advantages.html">it's well known</a>) the program doesn't require to be installed to be run on a machine, it can
  be executed from any media, including removable ones.

<h3>Copy the current program settings to phoa.ini</h3>
<p align=justify>If on, the current program settings will be <a href="setup-storing.html">saved to <b>phoa.ini</b> file</a> in the
  <a href="intf-file-ops-selfolder.html">destination fodler</a> during copy/move operation. This allows running the program from a removable media
  keeping all the current settings on any machine (but only if setting autoloading from <b>phoa.ini</b> is not disabled in that machine's 
  <a href="setup-general.html">settings</a>.)

<h3>Create autorun.inf file</h3>
<p align=justify>This option allows to automatically generate <b>autorun.inf</b> file placed in the <a href="intf-file-ops-selfolder.html">destination
  folder</a>. In this case inserting CD-ROM to a computer will cause automatic <b>PhoA</b> startup, and then the program will load the photo album
  specified above.
<div class=nb><b>NB:</b> Autorun is functional unless this feature is disabled on a machine.</div>

<h3>Label the media as</h3>
<p align=justify>Specifies media name that is displayed in <b>My computer</b>. The wizard uses <b>Photo album</b>, or current 
  <a href="intf-browse-mode-views.html">view</a> name by default.
<div class=nb><b>NB:</b> 
  <ul>
    <li>This field is optional, and can be left empty. <b>My computer</b> will display the media label if this is the case.</li>
    <li>Media label is displayed unless autorun feature is disabled on a computer.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p align=justify><b>ATTENTION:</b> all the contents of the folder designated as <a href="intf-file-ops-selfolder.html">destionation folder</a> must
  reside in the root directory of the written disk!
